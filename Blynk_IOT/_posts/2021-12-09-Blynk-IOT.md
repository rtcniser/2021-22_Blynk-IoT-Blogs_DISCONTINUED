&emsp; Here we will learn how to create our first project on the Blynk IOT platform. We will connect an LED to some pin on the NodeMCU. Then we will be able to controll it both through the blynk mobile app and the web portal through computers.

We will use **NodeMCU** throughout this tutorial. It is a WiFi capable Development Board based on the *ESP8266* microchip.

## <a name="Account"></a> Account

&emsp; First you have to go to the [Blynk Site](https://blynk.cloud/dashboard/login) site, and make an account.

&emsp; After you have logged in to your Blynk account, you will be able to see a dashboard like this:

## <a name="Templates"></a> Templates
&emsp; Before creating a device, you need to create a template first.
### <a name="What_are_Templates"></a> What are Templates?
&emsp; At first, you have to create a template for each type of device you have. For example, in this tutorial, we will control an LED through a button on your smartphone or laptop. At first we will make a template for a light, then we can make a device called light and tell that it belongs to this template.\
&emsp; Creating templates is somewhat like defining objects in programming and creating devices is like making instances of those objects. **There can be multiple devices under the same template.**

### <a name="How_to_Create_Templates"></a> How to Create Templates?
&emsp; To create a template, first click on the new template button on the dashboard and fill up the form. I am using a NodeMCU which is based on the *ESP8266* microchip. So, I have put **"Hardware = ESP8266"**.\
&emsp; This is how mine looks:

&emsp; Finally click on **Done** to create the template.\
&emsp; After creating the template, you will see something like this:

&emsp; Under the *Info* tab, you can further edit the data you have just entered along with some other fileds. **Remember** we are given 2 informations (BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID and BLYNK_DEVICE_NAME) under this Info tab. We will need those two pieces of informations later. So, we will return to this Info tab again while writing the code.\
&emsp; The *Metadata* tab is not essencial for device setup. So let us skip it and move on to the *Datastreams* tab.

## <a name="Datastreams"></a> Datastreams
&emsp; **According to Blynk:** Datastreams is a way to structure data that regularly flows in and out from device. Use it for sensor data, any telemetry, or actuators.
## <a name="What_are_Datastreams"></a> What are Datastreams?
&emsp; **There are various sorts of Datastreams, but here we will concentrate on "Virtual Pins" only.**
