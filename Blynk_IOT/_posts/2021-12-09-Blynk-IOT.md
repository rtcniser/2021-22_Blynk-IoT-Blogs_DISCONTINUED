&emsp; Here we will learn how to create our first project on the Blynk IOT platform. We will connect an LED to some pin on the NodeMCU. Then we will be able to controll it both through the blynk mobile app and the web portal through computers. We will use **NodeMCU** throughout this tutorial. It is a WiFi capable Development Board based on the **ESP8266** microchip.
