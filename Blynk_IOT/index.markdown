# What is Blynk IOT?

&emsp; **Blynk** is a very popular IoT platform. It helps its users to easily connect their devices to the cloud. Thus they can be easily operated from anywhere on the Globe.

&emsp; **Without Blynk**, one can access all his devices which are connected to the **local network** (suppose your home WiFi Router). But Blynk keeps all the data on the cloud and all the devices connected to the internet can access the data. Thus they can keep themselves updated about all the others. This makes it very **easy for different devices to work in tandem** to get a job done.
